    A few notes on the data collection process:
<ul>
    <li>The uncertainty of any single time measurement is assumed to be +-1μ.</li>
    <li>The uncertainty of the average is taken following the classic "when measurements add, their
        uncertainties add" rule of thumb. When taking the average of measurements with the same
        uncertainty this simplifies to the average having the same uncertainty as the values themselves.
        This approach is based on the assumption that the measured values are <i>accurate</i> though not
        necessarily precise, and thus the correct values are within +-1μ of the measured values.
    </li>
</ul>
